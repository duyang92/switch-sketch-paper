# Software Implementation
## Platform
We conducted our evaluation on a server equipped with two six-core Intel Xeon E5-2643 v4 3.40GHz CPU and 256GB RAM.
## Description
We implemented SwitchSketch, HeavyGuardian, WavingSketch, and DHS in C++ and Python. The C++ version is mainly used to evaluate throughput, and the Python version is mainly used to evaluate other metrics.
